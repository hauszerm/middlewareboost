BoostMiddlewareImporter.Properties.Settings
  MaxDegreeOfParallelism
    PERF; number of concurrent threads to transform the messages  

  TableBulkBatchSize
    PERF; SQLServer/RavenDB, chunk a batch by this number of records and send them to db even when batch has not finished yet  

  ThreadPoolPriority_DBInsert
    PERF; Task Priority of the db-insert-task when scheduled on the default thread pool  

  ThreadPoolPriority_Transformation
    PERF; task priority of the message transformation task scheduled on the default thread pool  

  TreadPoolPriority_TCPServer
    PERF; task priority of the tcp server tasks scheduled on the default thread pool  

  TCPServer_StatisticsPerMessagesCount
    UI; interval of messages per client that trigger statistics generation, use low value when the tcp client does not send a message per second  

  TCPServer_PostMessageToNextBlock
    when false, the received messages are not sent to the next hop  

  ThreadPoolForDBInsert
    PERF; when false, the db-insert-tasks schedules on a thread with highest priority  

  TCPServer_UseThreadPool
    PERF; If False, the TCP Servers schedules on Tasks on threads with lowest priority  

  BoundedCapacity
    DUR; Size of the buffer of each TPLDataflow block  

  CyclicDataFile
    configuration for the cyclicdata generator is read from this file  

  CyclicDataFilePeriod
    configuration for the perioddata generator is read from this file  

  MaxDegreeOfParallelismDBInsert
    PERF; Number of concurrent threads that bulkinsert the messages in the database, keep to 1 for Cassandra and RavenDB (DB Access API might not be threadsafe)  

  TableBulkInsertSize
    PERF; Group this number of records before starting a bulk insert, use max 2000 for cassandra because the byte-size of a batch request is limited https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6487  

  BoundedCapacity_DbInsert
    max size of the input queue of the db import action  

  CyclicPeriodDurationMinutes
    When using the PeriodMessageGenerator, define the number of minutes that should be generated  

  MaxDegreeOfParallelismAvgCalc
    number of parallel task triggering the calculation of averaging the documents  

  LoggingMessageCacheSize
    number of messages to cache for showing every second
